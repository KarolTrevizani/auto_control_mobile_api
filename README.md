# Auto Control API üöó

## Overview üìú

The Auto Control API is the backend part of a project aimed at providing comprehensive control over automotive-related expenses, user management, and vehicle tracking.

This project is developed collaboratively by a team of four: on the backend, [Karoline Trevizani](https://github.com/KarolTrevizani/auto_control_mobile_api), on the frontend [Rolf Matela](https://github.com/roollf) and [Emanuel Vidal](https://github.com/emanuelvidall), on the design [Fernando Cust√≥dio](https://github.com/Fcsla). The frontend can be found at [Frontend Repository URL](https://github.com/roollf/auto-control-mobile).

## Technical Stack üíª

- **Framework**: Django
- **API**: Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- **Database**: Configurable

## Environment Setup üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer
- pip (Python package installer)

Before starting, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies. This can be done using:

```bash
# Create the venv environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate the venv environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

After activating the virtual environment, install the project dependencies.

### Requirements File

The `requirements.txt` file contains all the necessary packages to run this project. Ensure you have this file in your project root and have run the command above to install these dependencies.

```bash
# Go to the dir where the requirements.txt are
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration üîß

### Environment Variables

_Go to the dir where the file .env.dist is (It stays in the project dir)_

To configure your project environment, copy the `.env.dist` file to `.env` in the same directory. Update this `.env` file with your specific configurations. The `.env.dist` file serves as a template outlining all necessary environment variables.

```bash
cp .env.dist .env
# Edit .env to fill in your specific settings
```

### Django Settings

This project uses two settings files for different environments:

- `development.py` for development settings
- `production.py` for production settings

To run the project using the correct settings, specify the settings module when executing Django commands. For example:

```bash
python manage.py runserver --settings=auto_control.settings.development
```

## Running the Application üèÉ

Ensure you have correctly set up your `.env` file and activated your virtual environment. To start the server with development settings, use:

```bash
python manage.py runserver --settings=auto_control.settings.development
```

## Running Migrate üóÉÔ∏è

When running the server you might see a warning:

```bash
You have X unapplied migration(s)...
```

To take advantage of Django's admin, auth, authtoken, content type, and sessions along with any models previously setup in any of your apps, you need to run the migrate script:

```bash
python manage.py migrate --settings=auto_control.settings.development
```

## Seeding Tables

To make the test easier, there are some tables that should be seeded. The following: `TypeVehicle`, `TypeExpense`, and `Brand`.
To seed, run the command below:
```shell
python manage.py seed --settings=auto_control.settings.development
```

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

The Auto Control API is built using Django Rest Framework (DRF) and contains three main apps:

- `expenses`: Handles all operations related to managing expenses.
- `users`: Manages user authentication, registration, and profiles.
- `vehicles`: Manages vehicle-related information and operations.
